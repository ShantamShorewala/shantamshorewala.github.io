Website under work!


I am a robotics enthusiast currently working as a research associate at the Autonomous Robotics Laboratory, IIT Delhi. Within robotics, my research interests include computer vision, motion planning, artificial intelligence and autonomous systems. I graduated from Manipal Institute of Technology in 2019 with a B.Tech. in Electronics & Communication. Previously, I have worked as a research intern at the [RBCCPS Lab at IISc, Bengaluru](https://cps.iisc.ac.in/) and also at [IIIT, Delhi](http://robotics.iiitd.edu.in/coral/). I also was the team lead of a robotics team, [Mars Rover Manipal](http://www.marsrovermanipal.com/), which develops Mars rover prototypes to compete at [University Rover Challenge](http://urc.marssociety.org/). 


Projects:

* Past
  - Link Speed estimation
