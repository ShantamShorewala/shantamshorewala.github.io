<p align="justify">
I am a robotics enthusiast currently working as a research associate at the Autonomous Robotics Laboratory, IIT Delhi. Within robotics, my research interests include computer vision, motion planning, artificial intelligence and autonomous systems. I graduated from Manipal Institute of Technology in 2019 with a B.Tech. in Electronics & Communication. Previously, I have worked as a research intern at the [RBCCPS Lab at IISc, Bengaluru](https://cps.iisc.ac.in/) and also at [IIIT, Delhi](http://robotics.iiitd.edu.in/coral/). I was also fortunate to have led a robotics team, Mars Rover Manipal, which develops Mars rover prototypes to compete at University Rover Challenge.

This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).
